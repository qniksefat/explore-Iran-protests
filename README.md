# Explore Iran protests data

Given that news agencies are pretty biased, I’m interested in finding relevant data sources (preferable foreign) and compile them to get to an answer or some insight. 
Especially right now with current situation in my homeland, Iran. this approach is inspired by Tetlock’s “super forecasting.”

Here, I took a look at [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/) data from conflicts in Iran after the death of Mahsa Amini. This include the news sources, location of protests, their type (whether riot or protests), and a bit of comparing it with other countries in the region. 
I saw the dataset first in [here](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/12/08/protest-movements-as-deadly-as-irans-often-end-in-revolution-or-civil-war)
and the goal is to, like the article, predict if such transition is possible. If so, is there a feature showing some significance?
